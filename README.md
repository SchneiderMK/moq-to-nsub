# moq-to-nsub

## What is this?

Super simple tool for converting a test project from moq to nsubstitute

## What's included

A command line tool with a single command, `convert`

## Usage

The root command is named `asos`, execute that to see the available sub-commands. Each sub-command will come with it's own set of sub-commands, creating a modular and hierarchical CLI, giving you a syntax like 

``` bash
moq2nsub convert --project-path C:\src\my-path-that-contains-unit-tests 
```
